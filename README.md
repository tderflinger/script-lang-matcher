# script-lang-matcher

This JSON file (script-lang-match.json) matches scripts (alphabets) to their languages.
ISO-15924 is used for the script codes. The languages codes are based on ISO-639-3.

Note that the Latin script is not included, because it is the default script.

In the JSON file, the "langs" key is an array of language codes based on ISO-639-3.
